As we have seen in the analysis, the goals scored and goals conceded 
metrics are not enough to generate an accurate prediction, since in a 
football game there are many other factors than the goals that each team 
can score per game.

In this case, as a practice, it works well for us to help us use the 
Pandas library and improve the understanding of the code, but in the case 
of making a good prediction we should take more factors into account.

In the second notebook entitled "final_and_champion_WC2022.ipynb" I show 
the prediction of the semifinals, the match for third place and the 
championship final, despite not being a very accurate prediction, I can 
say that I think this time it can be valid since it shows the results that 
the vast majority of the population thinks will happen.
