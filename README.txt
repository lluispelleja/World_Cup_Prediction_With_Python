This repository is a python practice to see what precision we can get only by analyzing the goals of the teams that participate in the 2022 world cup played in Qatar.

In the file we are going to simulate the entire world cup from the group stage to the final, as the project will start on December 10, depending on the results I will also simulate in other notebooks the current semifinal crosses and the final trying to make it as real as possible with the data that I have been able to obtain.

At the end of the world cup I am going to write a conclusion to validate the method that I have used for the prediction of the semifinals and the final.
